This is a project which I have done as part of Codebasics Analytics Bootcamp

Link to Interactive Dashboard

## Problem Statement

Atliq Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, Atliq Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of Atliq Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” in order to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party service provider to provide them insights from their historical data.
## Task

- Create the metrics according to the metric list.
- Create a dashboard according to the mock-up provided by stakeholders.
- Create relevant insights that are not provided in the metric list/mock-up dashboard.

## Takeaway from this project

- I recently started learning about data visualization, drawing inspiration from ([Naveen](https://github.com/Naveen-S6/AtliQ_Hospitality_Analysis_PowerBI)) project on GitHub & I used his methods to create two visuals to showcase the useful insights.
- Implemented a toggle button to effortlessly switch between revenue and average ratings, analyzed by months and property names.
- Utilized edit interactions with bookmarks and selections, enhancing the user experience.
- In order to get the hotel pricing strategies, created separate slicers in order to explore the static vs dynamic pricing during weekends and weekdays.
- Transformed my learnings into a comic-style storyboard using Canva's AI generator ([Canva](https://www.canva.com/)) & drawing Inspiration from Peter Pandey ([CodeBasics](https://codebasics.io/))
- Personalized the visuals using a unique color palette & style from ([Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/)) & ([color finder](https://imagecolorfinder.com/)).
